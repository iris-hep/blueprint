\section*{Major Goals}
\vspace{3pt}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Review the status of AS milestones and deliverables
  \item Develop the Scalable Systems Laboratory (SSL) scope, architecture and plans, using Analysis Systems (AS) R\&D activties as concrete examples.
  \item Develop requirements on SSL to support the AS area, particularly the prototyping, benchmarking and scaling of AS deliverables toward deployment.
  \item Increase the visibility of SSL and AS R\&D beyond IRIS-HEP to facilitate partnerships with organizations that could potentially provide software and computing resources for SSL.
  \item Get informed on latest developments in technologies and methods relevant for SSL and AS.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Key Outcomes}
\vspace{3pt}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Communication of the AS area plans and preliminary requirements to SSL.
  \item Kubernetes as a planned "common denominator" for SSL, increasing the capabilities through flexible infrastruture. This idea spawned plans for a multi-site SSL "substrate" project.
  \item Productive engagement of the AS/SSL team with representatives from NCSA, SDSC, NYU Research Computing, industry \& cloud providers (Google, Redhat), generating action items.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5pt}
~~~~Planning around
\vspace{-5pt}
\begin{itemize}
  \item collection and curatation of analysis use cases, each with a reference implementation.
  \item translation of analysis examples into new specifications, providing feedback and iteration.
  \item development of initial specifications for user-facing interfaces to analysis system components.
  \item benchmarking of existing analysis components and integrating the benchmarking into SSL.
  \item development of accelerator-based fitting \& statistical tools (and other relevant components).
  \item integrating prototypes of AS components into SSL, followed by benchmarking \& assessment.

\section{Overview}
Together with the OSG-LHC, the Scalable Systems Laboratory (SSL) is designed to be the primary integration path to deliver the output of IRIS-HEP R\&D activities into the distributed and scientific production infrastructure of the experiments. The aim of this workshop is to further develop the IRIS-HEP SSL concept using specific R\&D examples from the AS area, including  low-latency, query-based data systems and modular, reusable cyberinfrastructure for physics inference and results dissemination. Registered attendees include those from IRIS-HEP (primarily SSL and AS areas), US ATLAS/CMS operations programs, national labs, CERN, supercomputing centers (SDSC, NCSA), university research IT, and industry (RedHat, Google).

The venue for the workshop was the Physics Department at New York University and was hosted by Kyle Cranmer.
